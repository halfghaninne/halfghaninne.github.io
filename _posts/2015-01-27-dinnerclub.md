title:  "'Dinner Club', Classes, and separating the back-end from the front"
---

I'm revisitng and rewriting this blog post after a little bit more clarity on the Dinner Club project, but now don't entirely remember our prompt.

I can say that after working on both Dinner Club and Rock Paper Scissors, I'm still having some trouble conceptualizing the split from back- and front-end code, especially after so much of our prep work -- at least what I got through -- had us promting users directly. I'm also having some trouble conceptualizing the breakdown of Classes and methods; right now both my Classes and some of their methods are probably doing too much and could be further stratified.
