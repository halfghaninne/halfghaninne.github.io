What is "software development" as you understand it so far? What are the moving parts? Are those always the moving parts? Are they always called the same thing?

As I see it developing a software breaks down into these parts:

Logic/Planning
Back-end code-writing + Documenting
Testing
De-bugging
Front-end code-writing/Formatting

These might not always be the responsibilities of each programmer; they might split up these tasks.

Working in a pair was nice in that it kept me from getting bogged down. It was helpful to have another pair of eyes to remind me what might go where - SRP is a hard concept for me to understand.
