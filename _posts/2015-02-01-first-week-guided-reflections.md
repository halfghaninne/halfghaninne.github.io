title:  "Guided reflections on the first week of OCS:"
---

Journal entry: Answer these questions, to whatever degree of depth you like:

What is something you've learned so far that you could probably teach (i.e. explain to a reasonable degree of completion) to an interested but unexperienced friend?

  I think I could explain the relationship between Classes, Objects, and their methods; basic ideas of inheritance; and the differences between common object types (String, Float, Hash, Integer) and why a programmer might choose to store them one way or the other. 

What is something you think others in the class understand much better than you. Be very, very specific. Even if you're feeling insecure and want to say, "Pretty much everything". Pick something specific.

  I think there are students in the class who have a better knowledge of ruby methods at our disposal (* or matrices, for example) to simplify problem-solving.
  
  I also see several students in the class who seem more comfortable with technical vocabulary than I do. I think that writing documentation on Wednesday helped me overcome that frustration; I didn't feel as much translating going on in my brain on Friday.

Describe one or two highlights from this week that have nothing to do with coding.

  This week, we celebrated my grandmother's 82nd birthday! I ate a fat steak and gave her a present that she loves.

  Got back into the pool this weekend; hoping to maintain that routine during OCS.
