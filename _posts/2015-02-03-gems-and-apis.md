title:  "The difference between gems and APIs:"
---

Gems are self-contained packages of Ruby programs and libraries. APIs are sets of routines protocolos and tools (defined by operations) that one can use to build programs. An API is something that would be contained in a gem, like the `marvel_api` gem that I installed last night. My guess at one majore difference: one installs and requires a gem, not an API. 

Questions:
Is it incorrect to refer to an API as an index or library?
