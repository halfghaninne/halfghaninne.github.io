title:  "On working remotely:"

What was it like working remotely today? Did you miss seeing your classmates and instructors (If we may be so bold...) in person, and/or were interactions via Slack enjoyable in their own way? Was it hard to focus away from the school's space? Easier? How would you feel about working in a position where working remotely is the norm?

I really liked working remotely! Since we were doing such collaborative work with the feedback, it didnt really feel like there was an absence of my classmates and instructors. Having to be accountable online (and having a pretty full workload) held my feet to the flames, so to speak. It was helpful to have rigid guidelines and deadlines, and it was helpful to see other classmates submitting their work on time - that kept me focused. 

In my past few jobs as a journalist, working remotely has been a pretty loosey-goosey endeavor. Asking 16 journalists to each upload 3 YouTube or DropBox videos each...I'm sorry to say I think it would have been a disaster. It was nice doing it with colleagues who are savvy enough to make the most of tools that aid remote work. The one thing that did get confusing was all the slack channels. There is too much going on there!
