What was it like working remotely today? Did you miss seeing your classmates and instructors (If we may be so bold...) in person, and/or were interactions via Slack enjoyable in their own way? Was it hard to focus away from the school's space? Easier? How would you feel about working in a position where working remotely is the norm?
