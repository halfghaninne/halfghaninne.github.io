title:  "Disjointed reflections on the first day:"

I am not entirely sure if I am formatting this blog post correctly, but here goes.

Things I learned today:

It is possible (and not so scary) for the layperson to access and tinker with the innards of the computer, so much so that they can wipe out their harddrive. I mean, I knew people could do it - friends who have overwritten Windows OS to run iOS on their cheaper computers - but I didn't know it's, like, RIGHT THERE.

I had seen pieces of a project come together in a folder with different files for front-end and back-end code, but it was exciting getting a clearer idea of how they can be made into one neat package using git. 

A question: I still do not see the appeal of running Ruby in the terminal. It looks clunky and ugly and confusing. WHY do we do it? Is there any reason to run code there other than to check it (I think Sumeet had mentioned smaller applications that could be loaded in, I guess like accessing the Ruby file in the Terminal, but I'm not sure what the importance of that is - would that *install* the file)? If no other reason than to troubleshoot code, why not run checks in a more user-friendly program? Sheer convenience of staying in the same window?

A second question: I feel like I am just on the edge of seeing how git is helpful for collaborators. I see that multiple people can log commits on a folder (ie the journals folder had commits from Sumeet from before we even installed them.) Do I have to manually reload something to see any changes that Sumeet logs between Jan 21st when I installed the folder and today? Or would those changes be live? If they are live, how is it exactly that I am seeing them. I thought I was so saavy for understanding the cloud...that diagram made much more sense to me than the idea of local repositories.
