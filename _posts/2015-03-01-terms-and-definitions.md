What is a class?
A Class is a container that houses a set of behaviors (methods) and attributes.
Any object of a certain Class has those behaviors and attributes.

What is a model?
Models are "object relational mappers" - a way to organize files so that Sequel and Sinatra can interact with Ruby objects.

What is a method?
Methods are behaviors of a Class. Each Class only takes certain methods.

What is a variable?
Variables are representatives of values, phrases, equations. They can be placeholders for performing operations (local variables) or they can contain descriptive information* of an Object of a Class (instance variables).
*Not sure this is the best way to think of it.

What is a request?
A request is a direction given from a user (IP address) to a server. Often done by entering a URL, clicking a link, clicking a button.

What is a route?
A route is a direction that a request can be passed. (Defined by route handlers in the main.rb file of a program.)

In the context of a web application, what is a "response"?
A response is the return of the request. The request follows a route that ultimately returns an erb file that outputs specific requested Ruby information in HTML markup.
